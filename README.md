This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# catchapp-client

React-redux project to set a list of friends to catchup with and ways of doing so. For all of those negligent yous that forget to call Lucy, or whoever you wanted to call and just kept postponing.


Uses a rails db/api that lives here: https://github.com/melzreal/catchapp-api. You'll need to install the db first, have postgres running, rake db:create, rake db:migrate and rake db:seed to get a few friend examples.


The full goal of the app will be to have a friends list to catchup with, then addon Calendar/Friend Reminders, Todo Lists and a Meme feed for Meme sharing.

You may not always remember to text your friends but that's no excuse not to meme them xD
